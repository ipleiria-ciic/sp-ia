Code for the method [**\[ICCV 2023\] "TRM-UAP: Enhancing the Transferability of Data-Free Universal Adversarial Perturbation via Truncated Ratio Maximization", Yiran Liu, Xin Feng, Yunlong Wang, Wu Yang, Di Ming\***](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liu_TRM-UAP_Enhancing_the_Transferability_of_Data-Free_Universal_Adversarial_Perturbation_via_ICCV_2023_paper.html). 

A data-free universal attack to craft the universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) via truncated ratio maximization. This code depends on PyTorch.

## Update
 - Apr 27, 2024: We updated the parameter set of the curriculum learning-based training strategy in the file `strategy.py` and revised the parameter set of the UAP training to help other researchers reproduce our paper's results. We also uploaded the pre-trained UAPs with different surrogate models in the folder `perturbations`.
 - Feb 29, 2024: We updated the curriculum learning-based training strategy in the file `strategy.py` to provide a comprehensive illustration of the optimal experiment setup. Besides, the performance of TRM-UAP, as proposed in our paper, could be improved with further exploration of experimental hyperparameters.
## Dependencies

This repo is tested with pytorch=1.12.0, python=3.6.13.
Install all python packages using following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Preparation

ImageNet validation set:
   Load the parameters of pretrained models with PyTorch, download ImageNet dataset from [here](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/2012-downloads.php).
- `TorchHub` : the directory saves PyTorch pretrained model parameters.
- `dataset` : the directory contains the datasets.
- `perturbations` : the directory stores the UAP crafted by universal attacks. 



### 2. Training

For example, run the following command:

```
python train.py --surrogate_model vgg16 --target_model vgg19 --val_dataset_name imagenet 
                --p_active --n_active --p_rate 0.8 --n_rate 0.7
```
This will start a training to craft a UAP from the surrogate model vgg16 and attack the target model vgg19 on ImageNet with the positive and negative truncated activations correspondingly.


### 3. Testing
After a UAP is generated and saved on the directory `perturbations`, you can also load the UAP to attack other models:
```
python attack_test.py --test_model vgg19 --val_dataset_name imagenet --uap_path perturbations/uap_vgg16.npy
```
This will load the UAP made by vgg16 from `perturbations` and attack the target model vgg19 on imagenet.

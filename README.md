### Description

This repository is part of the SP-IA project, focusing on Secure and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning. The main objectives of this project include:

- Conducting a survey on the security and privacy risks associated with various machine learning techniques.
- Analyzing and proposing potential countermeasures to enhance security and privacy protection.
- Selecting, implementing, and experimentally evaluating alternative approaches.
- Preparing a final report and scientific papers in a suitable format for publication.

Please refer to the documentation and resources provided in this repository for more information on the SP-IA project and its progress.

### Content Overview
This repository covers a diverse range of resources and materials that have been carefully analised to support research and development in the field of security and privacy-preserving iof machine learning.

- **NB01-1023**: Contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks introducing the subject of computer vision.
- **NB02-1123**: Includes several Jupyter Notebooks for MNIST training, along with subsequent attacks (OnePixel Attack, FGSM, and Poisoning).
- **NB03-1223**: Presents a variety of Jupyter Notebooks introducing GANs and DCGANs.
- **NB04-0124**: Describes the process of creating a GAN capable of generating adversarial images to deceive a specific trained model.

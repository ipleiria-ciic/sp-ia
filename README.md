### Description

This repository is part of the `SP-IA` project, focusing on **Secure and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**. The main objectives of this project include:

- Conducting a survey on the security and privacy risks associated with various machine learning techniques.
- Analyzing and proposing potential countermeasures to enhance security and privacy protection.
- Selecting, implementing, and experimentally evaluating alternative approaches.
- Preparing a final report and scientific papers in a suitable format for publication.

Please refer to the documentation and resources provided in this repository for more information on the SP-IA project and its progress.

### Content Overview
This repository covers a diverse range of resources and materials that have been carefully analised to support research and development in the field of security and privacy-preserving of machine learning. All the folders follow a specific name convention: `{NB|PY}{ID}_{MONTH:02}{YEAR:02}`.

- **Notebooks**: It contains various `Jupyter Notebooks` created within the present project to assist with debugging and development.
- **PY01-0724**: Includes complete code for exporting and creating an image dataset regarding the perturbations generated using the [TRM-UAP](https://github.com/RandolphCarter0/TRMUAP) attack.
- **PY02-0824**: This folder includes the code required to build an DCGAN, utilising Optuna to optimize and identify the best hyperparameters.
- **PY03-0924**: This folder contains the code developed to build an adversarial DCGAN, using the TRM dataset developed as input.

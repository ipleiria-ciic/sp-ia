### Description

This repository is part of the SP-IA project, focusing on Secure and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning. The main objectives of this project include:

- Conducting a survey on the security and privacy risks associated with various machine learning techniques.
- Analyzing and proposing potential countermeasures to enhance security and privacy protection.
- Selecting, implementing, and experimentally evaluating alternative approaches.
- Preparing a final report and scientific papers in a suitable format for publication.

Please refer to the documentation and resources provided in this repository for more information on the SP-IA project and its progress.
